Analyzing Flight Data Using the nycflights23 Package : A Data Transformation Project in R

In this post, we will using data from the nycflights23 dataset which is package in R. So, let's take off into the data! ✈️
# Understanding data
The nycflights23 package has several datasets included:
- flights : Flight details, delays, destinations
- airlines : Carrier codes and airline names
- airports : Airport locations
- weather : Hourly weather at NYC airports
- planes : Aircraft details

Once we have the data, we will start doing Data Transformation. We will mainly use dplyr packages for data transformation.
dplyr is a package within the larger tidyverse collection of R packages. A package for data manipulation, offering functions for filtering, selecting, arranging, mutating, and summarizing data.

# Create 5 questions for data transformation to gain insights 
1. Top 5 carriers in April 2023
2. Top 5 destination in Y2023
3. Top 5 delays airline
4. Top 5 airlines with the most airplane
5. Top longest flight by airline name and destination
